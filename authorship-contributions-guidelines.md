# Professionalising traditional and infrastructure research roles in data science

# Acknowledgements and authorship guidelines

We recognise that we cannot do this project on our own and therefore we would like to take an inclusive approach to attribution for contributions to this project.

## Purpose
* To clarify authorship guidance for outputs that arise from the ‘Professionalising traditional and infrastructure research roles in data science’ project and which use data collected through the multi-stakeholder workshop and interviews.
Principles
* To recognise the collaborative nature of this project including the diverse group of people who have contributed to it.
* To represent inclusivity and generosity in authorship while recognising there is a need to meet authorship criteria in the spirit in which journals have written them.
* To recognise that authorship requires a meaningful contribution to the body of work leading to the publication.
* To provide clear, explicit criteria for authorship.
* To provide potential authors with the expectations this project has for authorship.

## Authorship criteria
We propose adopting the ICMJE criteria for authorship (as used, for example, by the Lancet).

The ICMJE guidelines provide a list of four criteria upon which authorship should be based;
1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data for the work; AND
2. Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

## Authorship format

The co-leads of the project (Emma Karoune and Malvika Sharan) will take the first and second author positions on all publications and then authors will be in alphabetical order.


## Contributor types to this project

### Workshop attendees
For attendees of our workshop in October 2023, we will be collecting notes and recordings to form a transcript and produce a summary of the event. 
Acknowledgements for contributions for this event will be done, first of all, at an organisational level by listing the organisations that attended. However, each attendee will be asked if they want further individual acknowledgement at the comment and review stage of the workshop summary and for the final policy briefing note.

### Interviewees and case study groups
For the policy briefing note, which is likely to be published in a journal, some workshop attendees will be interviewed in more depth to form case studies and this will also include members of The Alan Turing Institute staff. 

These contributors will be asked for explicit consent to use the interview data in the policy briefing note and will be acknowledged in this document. These contributors will also be asked if they want to be involved in the authorship of the policy briefing note but must agree to meet the authorship criteria above.

Taking part in an interview or case study will qualify the contributor for criterion 1 and therefore they will have to actively engage with the writing, editing and journal submission process to meet the rest of the author criteria.   



*These guidelines have been adapted from the authorship guidelines used in the DECOVID project.*

# Case studies of data science roles

Case studies of organisations with data science teams are being constructed using skills frameworks for each research role. 

The Alliance of Data Science Professionals have developed standards for Data Scientists and we are using these frameworks to develop similar frameworks for more specific data science roles
The Alliance of Data Science Professionals standards can be found [here](https://alliancefordatascienceprofessionals.co.uk//standards)

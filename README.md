## What this project is about and why is it important

The National Audit Office report on [‘Challenges in using data across government’](https://www.nao.org.uk/insights/challenges-in-using-data-across-government/) highlights the current gap in data skills at several levels including storage, management, architecture, planning and governance. The majority of these skills are essential for traditional data science research roles, and even more important for professionalising modern roles such as research engineers, data stewards, community managers, research application managers and more. These modern roles are often termed [research infrastructure roles](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles.html) and are becoming important alternative career pathways for researchers.

The skills gap identified by the National Audit Office is compounded by a lack of clarity in definitions for data science roles and their skill requirements. The [National Data Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy) states that there is no widely agreed definition of data skills and the role descriptors are used inconsistently across different institutions. Therefore, to enable the upskilling of the current workforce, develop more national and international consistency in hiring practices for these roles, and identify the skills needed by the next generation of data professionals, we need to close this knowledge gap by developing clear definitions of roles in data science and the skills needed to perform these roles. 

Our project seeks to lead in this area in collaboration with experts and diverse stakeholders curating both traditional and modern data science roles and skills to move forward their professionalisation. These curated resources will be communicated broadly to inform national policies.


## What we want to do
The objectives of this project are:
* Curating and centralising definitions, role descriptors and skill lists for traditional and modern data science roles in collaboration with the stakeholders from national and international institutions -- for use in policy, hiring and career development.
* Publishing a position paper focused on the newly established Community Management team in The Alan Turing Institute's Tools, Practices and Systems Programme and make comparisons to other data science roles professionalised at the Turing. This will serve as a prototype for creating position papers on other modern and lesser established data science roles.
* For the project leads to gain relevant skills by working with policy experts, networking with other awardees and collaborators, and utilising resources enabled by the Skills Policy Award in developing high-quality outputs that strengthen policies for the professionalisation of modern data science roles alongside the traditional roles in the UK.

## What this project needs
We want to know about the data science roles in your institution.
* what do these people do?
* what skills do they have?
* have you already developed job descriptors for these roles?
Please do connect with us and look out for our networking events. 

## Who we are
### Emma Karoune
Emma works in the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme as a Senior Community Manager. She oversee community management in the Turing Health programme including working with the Turing-RSS Health Data Lab and the DECOVID project. She is a core contributor to The Turing Way (an open-source community-led guide to reproducible research), and a member of the Bookdash planning committee, helping to build resources and training for other researchers. Emma's research background is in archaeobotany and she has been leading a project at Historic England on FAIR data.

### Malvika Sharan
Malvika is a Senior Researcher in the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme. She is leading on Open Research at The Alan Turing Institute and establishing a growing team of community managers. She is a co-lead investigator of The Turing Way project – a community-led handbook on data science, that aim to make research reproducible, collaborative, ethical and inclusive for researchers around the globe.
